# AutoLayout

> [!TIP]
> This guide covers details for the `AutoLayout` control. If you are just getting started with the Uno Toolkit UI Library, please see our [general getting started](../getting-started.md) page to make sure you have the correct setup in place.

## Summary

`AutoLayout` arranges child elements into a single row or column, depending on the `Orientation` property. The control is intended to reflect the same behaviors as the [AutoLayout Frame component in Figma](https://www.figma.com/widget-docs/api/component-AutoLayout).

### C# <!-- markdownlint-disable-line -->

```csharp
public partial class AutoLayout : Control
```

### XAML

```xml
xmlns:utu="using:Uno.Toolkit.UI"
...

<utu:AutoLayout>
    contents
</utu:AutoLayout>
```

### Inheritance

Object &#8594; DependencyObject &#8594; UIElement &#8594; FrameworkElement &#8594; Control

### Constructors

| Constructor     | Description                                              |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| AutoLayout() | Initializes a new instance of the `AutoLayout` class. |

### Properties

Property|Type|Description
-|-|-
Orientation | `Orientation` | Gets or sets the dimension by which the items are stacked
Spacing | `double` | Gets or sets a uniform distance (in pixels) between stacked items. It is applied in the direction of the `AutoLayout`'s Orientation
Justify | `AutoLayoutJustify` | Gets or sets the value to determine how items are justified within the container. Options are `Stack` or `SpaceBetween`. Note: if a child has its `PrimaryAlignment` set to `Stretch`, it will default to `Stack`
PrimaryAxisAlignment | `AutoLayoutAlignment` | Gets or sets the alignment characteristics that are applied to the content, based on the value of the `Orientation` property. Options are `Start`, `Center`, and `End`. The default is `Start`
IsReverseZIndex | `bool` | Gets or sets whether or not the ZIndex of the children should be reversed. The default is `false`
Padding | `Thickness` | **WARNING:** Padding for `AutoLayout` behaves the same as it does within the Figma Plugin: The anchor points determine which sides of the Padding will be taken into consideration. For example, items that are aligned to the Right and Top positions will only take the `Tickness.Right` and `Thickness.Top` values of `Padding` into consideration

### Attached Properties

Property|Type|Description
-|-|-
PrimaryAlignment|`AutoLayoutPrimaryAlignment`| Gets or sets the alignment characteristics that are applied to this element when it is composed in an `AutoLayout` parent, based on the value of the `Orientation` property. Options are `Auto` and `Stretch`. The default is `Auto`
CounterAlignment|`AutoLayoutAlignment`| Gets or sets the counter-alignment characteristics that are applied to this element when it is composed in an `AutoLayout` parent, based on the inverse value of the `Orientation` property. Options are `Start`, `Center`, `End`, and `Stretch`. The default is `Start`
PrimaryLength|`double`| Gets or sets the height or width of the child depending on the `Orientation`. If `Height` or `Width` are already set they will have priority.
CounterLength|`double`| Gets or sets the height or width of the child depending on the inverse of `Orientation`. If `Height` or `Width` are already set they will have priority.
IsIndependentLayout | `bool` | **WARNING:** Should not be used with other Attached Properties. Gets or sets whether the element is independent of the `AutoLayout` positioning. Reflects the `Absolute Position` option from Figma
